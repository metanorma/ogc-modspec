== Scope

This standard specifies some desirable characteristics of a standards specification
that will encourage implementations by minimizing difficulty determining
requirements, mimicking implementation structure and maximizing usability and
interoperability.

<<cls-6-1>> contains the UML model of a specification upon which this standard is
described. Annex C contains informal and non-normative definitions ordered for ease
of understanding. These two sections can be read first to aid in the understanding of
the rest of the document.
